* Project Learn More Things for Job Elgibility Engoodening
  This effort is to improve my job application eligibility by learning
  some modern new tech, creating something to point at and write about
  it as I go so others may also learn.
** General plan
   Create something using TypeScript, React and some other new hot
   backend tech. Stretch goal of applying k8s. Write about this at
   each step of the way in a separate blog.
*** Subject of work
    Track wins from the [[http://crawl.develz.org/play.htm][Dungeon Crawl servers]] and display them in a browser.
*** Scope of work
    The core of the work focuses solely on picking out wins in the
    "logs" of the official DCSS servers (but just 1 server to begin
    with) and making that data accessible and displayable.
    - A backend server to fetch the games and expose an API of recent
      wins
    - A key/value store for tracking the state of the backend server
    - A static content server that serves an SPA which displays the
      recent wins
    - Blog + posts, nothing overly fancy, most of the work should be
      thinking + writing not mucking about with blog software!
    - _Stretch_: A backend server which posts wins to Mastodon
      (account to be created on the [[https://botsin.space/][botsin.space]] server or other
      relevant server).
*** Tech stack
    - Deno as the runtime with the code written in TypeScript
    - React frontend of some kind, maybe just vanilla React?
    - Not sure for key/value store ??? Maybe just [[https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual][KV]]?
    - Blog in Hugo or Gatsby ... [[https://jamstack.org/generators/][too many damned options]]! Ok possibly
      also [[https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll][jekyll]] (generate on my Mac) or [[https://cryogenweb.org/docs/getting-started.html][cryogenweb]] because it's also
      clojure but not too fussed.
